hw2: Lorenz Attractor
hw2modeling: testing

CSCI 5229 Fall 2021

hw2modeling was purely for testing my object and rotating it
it is poorly maintained, poorly managed, and has no comments really
kept it in because it was really important to the process
it's where I figured out 3D object and rotating it

hw2 is a fun depiction of the Lorenz Attractor
it draws the lorenz, with different color when it changes rapidly
and it also draws 50 objects that travel along it
those 50 objects are 3D and point in the direction they are traveling
(almost, there are still a little clunky things but I couldn't
figure it out so close enough)
the objects have lines connecting them to each other and the origin
where the lines are colored by distance from the origin

Key bindings:
l change line drawing mode
Arrow keys rotate view
space reset view
ESC quit

1, 2, 3 some cool lorenz views

most effective to just hold them down rather than press
s increment s parameter
S decrement s parameter
b increment b parameter
B decrement b parameter
r increment r parameter
R decrement r parameter
